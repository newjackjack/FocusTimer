A full stack application built on Java Spring framework and database used in this app is MySQL. 

The Login and Registration feature was implemented because I can analyze the data from a certain user who logged in. 

The Login and Registration validations were implemented in Java Spring Boot App. 

After a user is logged in, one would be able to see the calendar and a section that shows all the tasks. 

The section next to it is a form that user can create new task. 

After creating new task, the user can see the newly created task show up on the right table. 

The title of the task is also a link to view the details of that task. 

The user can edit the task or delete the task if the logged in user is the creator of that task. 

Essentially, this feature allows user to do all the CRUD applications and all the routes follow the RESTful design. 

The whole program followed the MVC pattern.
